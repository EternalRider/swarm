# Localization
Current support for:
 * English -- https://github.com/oOve 
 * Your language ?

If you want to translate this module, download [this file](lang/en.json) and translate it. After that open an issue sharing your translation. Also share the default name convention for your language. You can find that by either, finding a system or module that is already translated to your language and open its module.json. It should look something like this: ``` "languages": [ { "lang": "en", "name": "English", "path": "lang/en.json" } ```
